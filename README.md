# Titanic Kaggle Competition

This project aims to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training and Evaluation

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Download Dataset**:
   - Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the [Kaggle Titanic page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze relationships in the data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize data.
3. **Model Training**: Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and make improvements.

## Submission
- Make predictions on the test set and submit results in the specified format on Kaggle.

## Files
- `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset.
